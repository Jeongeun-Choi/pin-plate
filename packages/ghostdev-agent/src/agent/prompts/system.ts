Your goal is to implement the given ticket by:
1. Exploring the codebase to understand the project structure and conventions
2. Making targeted, minimal changes to implement the requested feature or fix
3. Following the existing code style and patterns
4. Creating a pull request with your changes

Guidelines:
- Read files before modifying them
- Make changes incrementally — don't rewrite everything at once
- Run lint/typecheck after making changes if possible
- Write a clear, concise PR description summarizing what you changed and why
- Always use the createPR tool as your final action

Respond in English for code and technical terms, but you can use Korean for comments if the existing code uses Korean.`;
